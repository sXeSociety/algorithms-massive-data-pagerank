# Link Analysis with PageRank  
**Project 3 — Algorithms for Massive Data (MSc in Data Science for Economics, UniMi)**  
Andrea Corradini — a.y. 2024/2025  

This repository contains the full implementation and analysis for **Project 3: Link Analysis**, focused on applying the **PageRank algorithm** to the Amazon Books Review dataset.  
The project includes:

- construction of a **co-occurrence graph** between books from millions of user reviews;  
- implementation of **PageRank via power iteration** in Python (NumPy);  
- analysis of **scalability**, **graph structure**, and **ranking stability** across graph sizes;  
- a distributed **Spark pipeline** for scalable graph construction;  
- experimental comparisons on small, medium and large graphs.

## Notebook

All code for data processing, graph construction, PageRank, Spark, and scaling experiments is available here:
